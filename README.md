## ✨ What You'll Find Inside

Here's a glimpse into the exciting SQL content awaiting you:

### 🧹 1. Data Cleaning Project

**Goal:** Transform messy, raw data into a clean, standardized, and usable format.
**Highlights:**

  * **Staging Tables:** Learn the importance of working with staging tables to protect original data.
  * **Duplicate Handling:** Master techniques for identifying and removing duplicate records.
  * **Data Standardization:** Clean inconsistencies in text fields (e.g., company names, industries, countries).
  * **Date Format Conversion:** Convert text dates to proper `DATE` formats for chronological analysis.
  * **Null Value Management:** Strategically handle missing data points to ensure data integrity.

### 📈 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Layoffs Data

**Goal:** Uncover trends, patterns, and outliers within a real-world dataset of employee layoffs.
**Highlights:**

  * **Aggregations:** Use `SUM`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `COUNT` to summarize key metrics.
  * **Temporal Analysis:** Analyze layoff trends over time (yearly, monthly, rolling totals).
  * **Ranking & Partitioning:** Identify top performers (or in this case, top layoff companies) using powerful window functions like `ROW_NUMBER()`.
  * **Insights Generation:** Learn to extract meaningful insights from data to inform decision-making.

### 📚 3. SQL Fundamentals

**Goal:** A comprehensive guide covering the essential building blocks of SQL.
**Highlights:**

  * **DDL & DML:** Practice creating databases, tables, and manipulating data (`INSERT`, `DELETE`).
  * **Basic Queries:** Master `SELECT` statements, `DISTINCT`, `WHERE` clauses with various operators.
  * **Grouping & Ordering:** Understand `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY` for data summarization and sorting.
  * **Joins & Unions:** Combine data from multiple tables using different join types and `UNION` operations.
  * **Advanced Concepts:** Explore string functions, `CASE` statements, subqueries, and temporary tables.
  * **Procedural SQL:** Get introduced to stored procedures, triggers, and events for automating tasks.
